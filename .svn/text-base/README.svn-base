Project 1: The CS61B Drawing System.

The files in this directory form a very sketchy skeleton that you are
to flesh out into a full system.


Files:


Makefile:      This simple Makefile does standard tasks such
               as building the application, cleaning up unneeded files, and
               running the JUnit tests.  Used as a configuration file 
               by the 'gmake' program.

PUBLIC-VERSION:
               A file containing just the name of the current public release
               version in the public/proj1/tags directory.  (Helpful when
               trying to figure out what merges to do.)

duo (subdirectory):  The package containing the game program.

    Makefile:  See Makefile, above.

    Main.java: Contains the main method for the system.

    Testing.java: 
               The main program here runs all your JUnit tests.  Your tests
               may be scattered over many classes, but this is a kind of
               central index of all of them, and has a few useful methods 
               for use in some tests.

    Board.java, MutableBoard.java, Color.java, Player.java, 
    Human.java, AI.java:
               SAMPLE source files, hinting at part of ONE POSSIBLE
               implementation (object analysis) of the system.

    UI.java
               An interface representing a user interface.  By going through
	       an interface, we make it easier (in later assignments) to
	       convert from text I/O to graphical I/O.
    TextUI.java
               An implementation of UI.java intended that uses the terminal
	       for input and output.

duo-tests (subdirectory): 
               Directory of test files. Used by gmake check.

~cs61b/bin/test-duo:
               Script to run regression tests against the complete duo 
               program.  The tests in duo-tests specify the tests that this
               script runs.  Used by gmake check.
